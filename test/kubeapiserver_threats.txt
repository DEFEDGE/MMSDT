Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
Description:
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a system attack in which an unauthorized actor gains access to the infrastructure and remains undetected. The intention of an APT attack is to locate and steal data and evade detection, rather than to cause damage to the network or organization. APT attacks target organizations in sectors with high-value information, such as national defence, manufacturing, infrastructure, medical, scientific, and the financial industry.

Denial of Service
Description:
DoS and DDoS are both denial-of-service attacks. The attacks work by requesting more resources from a server than the server has available. In the case of DoS, it is an attack that originates from a single device, as opposed to DDoS which is distributed and relies on multiple devices.

Missing Function Level Access Control
Description:
Many applications check the level of access rights before its functionality is made visible in the user interface. However, applications need to perform access control on the server each time the feature is accessed. If access requests are not verified, the attackers can falsify them to gain unauthorized access to features.

File System Profiling
Description:
File system profiling attacks attempt to use access type, timestamps of last modification, file names, and other file system metadata to gain insight about storage system operation. For example, if a set of files are accessed in regular patterns, the attacker may infer the importance, function, and possibly even the content of these files.
