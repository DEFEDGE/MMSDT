Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
Description:
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a system attack in which an unauthorized actor gains access to the infrastructure and remains undetected. The intention of an APT attack is to locate and steal data and evade detection, rather than to cause damage to the network or organization. APT attacks target organizations in sectors with high-value information, such as national defence, manufacturing, infrastructure, medical, scientific, and the financial industry.
