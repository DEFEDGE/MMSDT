Account Hijacking
Description:
In account hijacking, a hacker uses a compromised account to impersonate the account owner. Typically, account hijacking is carried out through social engineering, phishing, sending spoofed emails to the user, password guessing or a number of other hacking tactics. In many cases, the outcome of an account hijacking is the hacker will have full system access and the ability to laterally access other systems on the target user network. The effective breach scope may expand to other services, such as financial and social networks, due to password re-use across services.

Weak Identity, Credential & Access Management
Description:
Lack of highly scalable identity access management systems, lack of multi-factor authentication capabilities, weak password usage, and lack of ongoing automated rotation of cryptographic keys, passwords, and certificates. Furthermore, hygiene of credentials ranging from embedding in source code and distribution in publicly available source code may be considerations.

Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)
Description:
An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a system attack in which an unauthorized actor gains access to the infrastructure and remains undetected. The intention of an APT attack is to locate and steal data and evade detection, rather than to cause damage to the network or organization. APT attacks target organizations in sectors with high-value information, such as national defence, manufacturing, infrastructure, medical, scientific, and the financial industry.

DENIAL OF SERVICE

Denial of Service
Description:
DoS and DDoS are both denial-of-service attacks. The attacks work by requesting more resources from a server than the server has available. In the case of DoS, it is an attack that originates from a single device, as opposed to DDoS which is distributed and relies on multiple devices.

Missing Function Level Access Control
Description:
Many applications check the level of access rights before its functionality is made visible in the user interface. However, applications need to perform access control on the server each time the feature is accessed. If access requests are not verified, the attackers can falsify them to gain unauthorized access to features.

Sensitive Data Exposure
Description:
Many web applications do not adequately protect data such as credit card numbers or authentication credentials. Attackers can take possession of the data or take advantage of the weaknesses in the security measures for the theft of credentials, for fraudulent transactions with CdC, etc. This type of data, require additional protective measures, such as encryption for data in transit, as well as special precautions when they are exchanged with the browser.
